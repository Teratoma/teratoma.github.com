Ink Girl was a character in Rickey Rat Comics.

Her first appearance was in Rickey Rat Comics #5. She was a "mutant" as per Marvel Comics' X-Men. Her "power" was that she excreted an ink-like substance at all times.

After creating the "All-Stud Bowling Team" and "Aloe-Vera Croquet Squad", it was discovered that many of these team's members had real-life counterparts among their creator's associates. I must re-iterate: these characters were not deliberately designed to represent anyone in particular. It was only in retrospect that we realized some of the characters were undeniably represented in the 'real world' by so-and-so and so-and-so.

Anyway, the real-life Ink Girl ended up - several years later - getting facial tattoos.

Ink Girl.
